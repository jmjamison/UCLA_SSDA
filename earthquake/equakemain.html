<p>
Earthquake related behavior is an important part of disaster research in California. 
Behavior during and immediately after earthquakes is influenced by a range of socioeconomic,  
situational, and social psychological factors. Here you will find survey data collected as 
part of research at the University of California, Los Angeles about the knowledge, 
attitudes and behaviors of individuals in responding to earthquakes. As other earthquake 
studies become publicly available, they will be added to this site.  If you are interested in
our other earthquake materials, here is the <a href="http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/issr/da/earthquake/erthqkstudies.index.html">
link</a> to that site.
