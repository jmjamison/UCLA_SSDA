            </span>

            The  Department of Homeland Security funded a Center for Excellence called the  National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (NC  START) based at the University of Maryland, College Park. Dr. Linda Bourque  received the two sub-awards through NC START as well as two additional grants  from the National Science Foundation to conduct a national household telephone  survey about people's experiences, preparedness and mitigation actions, and  perceptions related to terrorism and disasters. A stratified sample of 3,300  households selected by random digit dialing was interviewed using  computer-assisted telephone interviews. Of the total sample, 1,000 households  were selected from areas considered at high risk of terrorism (Washington,  D.C.; New York City; Los Angeles), and 2,300 households were selected from  throughout the rest of the continental United States. The study collected  information on: household and individual demographic data; past experience with  disasters; respondents; definition of terrorism; cues to prepare; preparedness  information received passively; trust in government organizations;  terrorism-related knowledge; perceived risk; information-seeking and milling;  perceived as resilience/self-efficacy; perceived response effectiveness;  preparedness and mitigation actions; and behavioral intentions. </p>
