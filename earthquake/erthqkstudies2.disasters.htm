    </h3>

    <p align="left

    ">School  emergency preparedness is essential to prevent and minimize the health and  social impact of hazards on the school community, including children, teachers,  staff, their families and those who live or work near schools.&nbsp; Between  September 2005 and February 2006, a mail survey was administered to  representatives of 200 public school districts and 470 public schools, grades K  through 12, located in 34 of the 58 counties in California.&nbsp; Responses  were obtained from 98 school districts and 157 schools.&nbsp; Data from the  survey were analyzed to describe the schools&rsquo; prior experiences with emergencies  and disasters, the available resources for preparedness, their current levels  of preparedness, and their needs for improving preparedness.

    </h3>

  <br>

      Timely  evacuation of populations threatened by wildfires is essential to prevent fatal  and non-fatal injuries from exposure to fire, smoke, and other secondary  hazards.&nbsp; There has been a paucity of studies that examine the  characteristics of official community evacuation plans and their potential to  minimize damage in wildfire disasters, especially in densely populated areas  where wildfire may spread to residential areas.&nbsp; This study will describe  and evaluate official evacuation plans for California counties at high risk of  wildfires.&nbsp; A content analysis will be performed on evacuation plans  obtained from 58 California county offices of emergency management using 20  criteria developed by the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Department  of Homeland Security for an evaluation of catastrophic hurricane evacuation  plans.&nbsp; The evaluation of plans will be augmented by key informant  interviews with emergency management officials in the respective counties to  identify the strengths and weaknesses of their current evacuation plans and  their expectations regarding the public&rsquo;s response to evacuation orders.&nbsp;  Findings from this study will be translated into a model template and  guidelines that can be used by emergency management officials to create or  improve their wildfire evacuation plans.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is anticipated that  this study will provide the basis for developing a large project involving a  broader household survey on evacuations and the health and social impact of  wildfires in Southern California communities repeatedly affected by wildfires.<br>

  <h3 align="left"><font color="#006699">Exploratory Study of Disaster  Preparedness in Southern California Immigrant Communities</font><br>

    </h3><br>

      This  study will explore issues related to disaster preparedness among underserved,  Latino and Asian immigrant and limited-English proficient (LEP) communities in  Southern California using a multi-lingual survey.&nbsp; This study builds upon  a qualitative research study conducted in 2007 by the Asian Pacific American  Legal Center (APALC) in collaboration with the Tom&aacute;s Rivera Policy Institute  (TPRI) at the University of Southern California.&nbsp; This study involved key  informant interviews with government and non-government organizations and focus  groups with Asian and Latino immigrant community members residing in four  Southern California cities.&nbsp; The study identified formal and informal  disaster-preparedness and -response networks and resources and how they are  prepared to serve immigrant and LEP populations.&nbsp; It also identified  barriers to disaster preparedness for these minority communities.&nbsp; The  significance of the qualitative study could be bolstered by a survey of the  same population that replicates and quantifies its findings.&nbsp; Results from  the survey can be translated into recommended policies and practices for  government and emergency response organizations to eliminate disparities in  disaster preparedness, response, relief and recovery, not only in Southern  California but also in areas with similar demographics throughout the  nation.&nbsp; Some of the project activities will be performed under a  subcontract to APALC, as specified in a separate project report.<br>

  <h3 align="left"><font color="#006699">California Survey of Household  Earthquake Preparedness and Mitigation</font><br>

    </h3>

  <br>

  This study, funded by the California Governor's Office  of Emergency Services, the California Seismic Safety Commission, the Institute  for Business and Home Safety, and the Southern California Association of  Governments, will document the current state of household mitigation and  preparedness for disasters in the State of California with an emphasis on  earthquakes. The study will determine the current state of household mitigation  and preparedness for the state as a whole, select racial and ethnic minorities,  and different geographical areas at high risk of earthquakes. The research will  also identify the key processes that lead households to take mitigation and  preparedness actions. Computer-assisted telephone interviews will be conducted  with a total of 2,000 households selected by random-digit-dialing. The sample  is equally divided across three strata: 10 northern counties at high risk of  earthquakes, 6 southern counties at high risk of earthquakes, and the rest of  the state. </p>
