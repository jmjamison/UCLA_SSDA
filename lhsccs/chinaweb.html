<blockquote>

<blockquote>As part of

the project "Life Histories and Social Change in Contemporary China," a

national probability sample survey was conducted in the People's Republic

of China during June-October1996. Interviews were completed for 6,090 Chinese

adults, aged 20-69 (3,087 urban residents and 3,003 rural residents). As

part of the fieldwork operation for the rural survey, a survey of 383 village

leaders was also carried out, using the same questionnaire.

<p><b><i>The

sample of village leaders (sample=3) is not part of the general population

sample, and should always be treated separately.&nbsp; Also, since the

rural and urban populations were sampled at different rates, and since

the data were weighted to correct for differential household size (number

of adults per household), the data should always be weighted (using the

variable 'weight') when estimates for a representative sample are desired.

Finally, because the sample (like most national sample surveys) is highly

clustered, survey estimation procedures are strongly recommended to ensure

correct standard errors. Specify the sampling stratum by using the variable

"stratum" and the psu by using the variable "psu".</i></b>

<p>The project was initiated

in 1994 by Donald J. Treiman, UCLA,&nbsp; Ivan Szelenyi, then at UCLA and

now at Yale, and Andrew Walder, then at Harvard and now at Stanford University,

in cooperation with staff of the Department of&nbsp; Sociology, People's

University, Beijing. Unfortunately, Prof. Szelenyi found it necessary to

withdraw from the project in early 1996 due to the press of other commitments.

Funding was obtained by Treiman, Szelenyi, and Walder from the U.S. National

Science Foundation, the Luce Foundation, the Ford Foundation–Beijing, and

the University of California Pacific Rim Research Program.

<p>In addition, we acknowledge

assistance provided to the project by the Netherlands Institute for Advanced

Study in the Humanities and Social Sciences, where Treiman was a Fellow-in-Residence

during 1996-97; by the Division of the Social Sciences, Hong Kong University

of&nbsp; Science and Technology, where Walder served as head from 1995-97;

and by Prof. Thomas Chan, Hong Kong Polytechnic University and CERD Associates.

Special assistance in designing the sample was provided by Prof. William

Cumberland, Department of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, UCLA;

by Dr. Ma Zhongdong, Division of the Social Sciences, Hong Kong University

of Science and Technology; and by Prof. Wang Feng, then in the Program

on Population, East-West Center, Honolulu, Hawaii, and now in the Department

of Sociology, University of California at Irvine. Finally, Li Bobai, then

a graduate student at Stanford, and Song Shige, then at the People's University,

Beijing, took special responsibility for creating an analysis-ready dataset.

access to the documentation and data for the study described above.

<p><b>Bibliography:</b>

<p>On a separate page,

bibliographic citations of works using the CLHS are provided.&nbsp; Researchers

are encouraged to use the bibliography in their work and to submit citations

for published and unpublished works, conference papers, journal articles,

monographs, dissertations and theses.&nbsp; If the work can be shared with

others, authors are encouraged to send a PDF format version of the material

and a link from the bibliographic citation to the paper will be provided

via the CLHS web site.&nbsp; Click here to go to the <a href="bibliography_CLHS.html#Top">Bibliography.</a>

<p><b>Codebooks:</b>

<p>The codebook is divided

into five parts, plus a number of appendices, and a list of cited references;

the pages are numbered within parts. The remainder of Part I provides documentation

pertaining to the questionnaire as a whole: descriptions of the sample

design and reports on the fieldwork for each survey; methods for analyzing

stratified samples; a list of all variables in the file; an alphabetical

index of variable names; etc. Part II provides the codes for all variables

coded directly from the questionnaire. In Part III constructed variables,

such as recoded occupation and education information, family characteristics,

etc., are shown. Part IV is the codebook for a file of occupation information;

Part V is the codebook for a file of information on the characteristics

of the sampling points, which has been incorporated into the main data

file. Part VI includes the Appendices.&nbsp; Appendices A and B give codes

for response categories used repeatedly throughout the questionnaire. Appendix

A gives the “Show Cards” used as response categories. Appendix B gives

the codes for the occupation classifications used in the study. Appendix

C gives the Stata 5.0 commands used to create the constructed variables

shown in Part III. Appendix D contains a report on work undertaken to design

the sample and lists of sampling points. Appendix E gives the instructions

to interviewers, in English and Chinese. Appendix F reproduces the Chinese

language questionnaire. We do not provide an English language version of

the questionnaire since it would largely duplicate Part II. Finally, Part

VII gives a list of references to materials cited throughout the codebook.

<p><em><strong>The current version of the codebook is not quite in final form.&nbsp; A few

sections remain to be translated, the English needs occasional clarification,

some references need to be completed, etc. We hope to make these final

corrections in the near future.</strong></em>
