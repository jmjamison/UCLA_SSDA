<h1>Tools for Exploring Data</h1>               
    
      <p><strong>	This section contains links to interesting tools mostly for visualization of data; these are not intended to replace careful and scientifically valid statistical analysis of data but are provided as a supplement to engage users and encourage discussion. </strong></p>
      
        <a href="http://www-958.ibm.com/software/data/cognos/manyeyes/"><strong>Many 
        Eyes</strong></a> Free site where you can upload and share datasets and do <a href="http://services.alphaworks.ibm.com/manyeyes/page/Visualization_Options.html">visualizations</a>  including maps, graphs, charts, histograms, scatterplots, tree diagrams,  and tag clouds among others. Useful for locating data or visualizations  on a variety of topics. <br>
<br>

<a href="http://www.data360.org/index.aspx"><strong>Data 360</strong></a> Users can upload datasets or data visualizations to share with others. Searchable. <br>
<br>

 <a href="http://www.statcrunch.com/"><strong>StatCrunch</strong></a> 
 For a small fee you can upload datasets and do analysis. This might be 
 helpful for students who do not want to pay for STATA or SPSS. There is 
 an fairly extensive <a href="http://www.statcrunch.com/features.php">list</a> of statistical analyses possible. <br>
  <br>
  
<a href="http://www.visualcomplexity.com/vc/"><strong>Visual Complexity</strong></a> &nbsp;This site &quot;intends to be a unified resource space for anyone interested in the visualization of complex networks. The project's main goal is to leverage a critical understanding of different 
visualization methods, across a series of disciplines, as diverse as Biology, Social Networks or the World Wide Web.&quot; You can do searches by topics and then read detailed descriptions of how and why the visualization was created and what it intends to show or describe.</p>
