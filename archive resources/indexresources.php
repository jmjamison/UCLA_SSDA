        <a href="http://3stages.org/idata/"><strong>Data on 
        the Web</strong></a> &nbsp;&nbsp;DOTW was conceived of and originally built by Jim Jacobs, former Data Archivist at the University of California, San Diego. This site is being revised and refined but the original version  can still be used. A description on the DOTW site reads &quot;Search or browse our listing of 363 Internet sites of numeric Social Science statistical data, data catalogs, data libraries, social science gateways, addresses and more. &quot; <br>

        <a href="../Mobility/mobindex.html"><strong>ISMF 
Mobility Data Index</strong></a> &nbsp;&nbsp;The ISMF project was a joint effort among faculty at UCLA and Utrecht University and the Data Archive at UCLA to identify a collection of datasets used in the study of cross-national, intergenerational social stratification and mobility. The index can be searched by country, study title and keyword. The International Stratification and Mobility File is a collection of harmonized sample survey data with information on social stratification and social mobility, in particular respondent's and parent's social statuses (education, occupation). Further  details about the ISMF are included on this site.</p>
