<p><a href="http://electionstudies.org/"><strong>American National 

Election Studies</strong></a> On March 6, 2001, the Secretary of Commerce decided that unadjusted data from Census 2000 should be used to tabulate population counts reported to states and localities pursuant to 13 U.S.C. 141(c) (see 66 FR 14520, March 13, 2001). These numbers are not official Census 2000 counts. These numbers are estimates of the population based on a statistical adjustment method, utilizing sampling and modeling, applied to the official Census 2000 figures.</p>

      <p><a href="http://usa.ipums.org/usa/"><strong>IPUMS USA</strong></a> This is a project dedicated to collecting and distributing United States census data. The resources here allow you to make subsets of US Census 

 data across censuses and for selections of variables or geography. &quot;The Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) consists of thirty-nine high-precision samples of the American population drawn from fifteen federalcensuses and from the American Community Surveys of 2000-2006. Some of these samples have existed for years, and others were created specifically for this database. The thirty-nine samples, which draw on every surviving census from 1850-2000, and the 2000-2006 ACS samples, collectively comprise our richest source of quantitative information on long-term changes in the American population.&quot;</p>



      <p><a href="https://international.ipums.org/international/"><strong>IPUMS  International</strong></a> As with the IPUMS USA this project aims to make available census data from countries around the world. Census files are currently available for 35 countries. </p>

      <p><a href="http://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/addhealth"><strong>National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health)</strong></a> &quot;is a longitudinal study of a nationally representative sample of   adolescents in grades 7-12 in the United States during the 1994-95   school year. The Add Health   cohort has been followed into young adulthood with four in-home   interviews, the most recent in 2008, when the sample was aged 24-32. Add Health   combines longitudinal survey data on respondents&rsquo; social, economic,   psychological and physical well-being with contextual data on the   family, neighborhood, community, school, friendships, peer groups, and   romantic relationships, providing unique opportunities to study how   social environments and behaviors in adolescence are linked to health and achievement outcomes in young adulthood. The fourth wave of interviews expanded the collection of biological data in Add Health to understand the social, behavioral, and biological linkages in health trajectories as the Add Health cohort ages through adulthood.&quot; (<em>from the Add Health website</em>) Data access is provided by <a href="http://www.icpsr.umich.edu">ICPSR</a> and <a href="http://www.socio.com">Sociometrics</a>.</p>
